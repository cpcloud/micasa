Attach files to your home records -- warranties, manuals, invoices, photos.

## Adding a document

1. Switch to the Docs tab (`f` to cycle forward)
2. Enter Edit mode (`i`), press `a`
3. Fill in a title and optional file path, then save (`ctrl+s`)

If you provide a file path, micasa reads the file into the database as a BLOB
(up to 50 MB). The title auto-fills from the filename when left blank.

You can also add documents from within a project or appliance detail view --
drill into the `Docs` column and press `a`. Documents added this way are
automatically linked to that record.

## Fields

| Column | Type | Description | Notes |
|-------:|------|-------------|-------|
| `ID` | auto | Auto-assigned | Read-only |
| `Title` | text | Document name | Required. Auto-filled from filename if blank |
| `Entity` | text | Linked record | E.g., "project #3". Only shown on top-level Docs tab |
| `Type` | text | MIME type | E.g., "application/pdf", "image/jpeg" |
| `Size` | text | File size | Human-readable (e.g., "2.5 MB"). Read-only |
| `Notes` | notes | Free-text annotations | Press `enter` to preview |
| `Updated` | date | Last modified | Read-only |

## File handling

- **Storage**: files are stored as BLOBs inside the SQLite database, so
  `micasa backup backup.db` backs up everything -- no sidecar files
- **Size limit**: 50 MB per file
- **MIME detection**: automatic from file contents and extension
- **Checksum**: SHA-256 hash stored for integrity
- **Cache**: when you open a document (`o`), micasa extracts it to the XDG
  cache directory and opens it with your OS viewer

## Entity linking

Documents can be linked to any record type: projects, incidents, appliances,
quotes, maintenance items, vendors, or service log entries. The link is set
automatically when adding from a drill view, or can be left empty for
standalone documents.

The `Entity` column on the top-level Docs tab shows which record a document
belongs to (e.g., "project #3", "appliance #7").

## Drill columns

The `Docs` column appears on the **Projects** and **Appliances** tabs, showing
how many documents are linked to each record. In Nav mode, press `enter` to
drill into a scoped document list for that record.

## Extraction pipeline

When you save a document with file data, micasa runs a three-layer extraction
pipeline to pull structured information out of the file. Each layer is
independent and degrades gracefully when its tools are unavailable.

### Layer 1: text extraction

Runs immediately during save. Extracts selectable text from PDFs using
`pdftotext` (from poppler-utils) which preserves reading order and table
layout. Plain-text files are read directly. Images skip this layer entirely.

### Layer 2: OCR

Triggers automatically when text extraction returns little or no text (scanned
PDFs) or when the file is an image (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.). Requires
`pdftoppm` (for PDF rasterization) and `tesseract` to be installed. If these
tools are missing, OCR is silently skipped.

The OCR phase shows live progress in an overlay: rasterization page count, then
per-page OCR status.

### Layer 3: LLM extraction

When an LLM is configured, micasa sends the extracted text to a local model
that returns structured JSON: document type, suggested title, vendor name, cost
breakdowns, dates, warranty expiry, entity links, and maintenance schedules
extracted from manuals.

These hints **pre-fill form fields** -- the user always reviews and confirms
before anything is saved. The LLM never writes to the database directly.

The extraction model can be configured separately from the chat model (a small,
fast model works well here). See [Configuration]({{< ref
"/docs/reference/configuration" >}}) for the `[extraction]` section.

### Extraction overlay

An overlay shows real-time progress during OCR and LLM extraction. Each step
displays a status icon, elapsed time, and detail (page count, character count,
model name).

When extraction completes successfully, press `a` to accept the results and
apply them to the document. On error the overlay stays open showing which step
failed. Press `esc` at any time to cancel extraction and close the overlay.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a` | Accept results (when done, no errors) |
| `esc` | Cancel and close |
| `j`/`k` | Navigate steps |
| `enter` | Expand/collapse step logs |
| `r` | Rerun LLM step |

See [Keybindings]({{< ref "/docs/reference/keybindings" >}}) for the full
reference.

### Requirements

| Tool | Used for | Install |
|------|----------|---------|
| `pdftotext` | PDF text extraction | Part of `poppler-utils` |
| `pdftoppm` | PDF rasterization for OCR | Part of `poppler-utils` |
| `tesseract` | OCR on rasterized pages and images | `tesseract-ocr` package |
| Ollama (or compatible) | LLM-powered structured extraction | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) |

All external tools are optional. Without `pdftotext`, PDFs still save but
without extracted text. Without `tesseract`, scanned documents and images skip
OCR. Without an LLM, no structured hints are generated. The document always
saves regardless.

## Inline editing

In Edit mode, press `e` on the `Title` or `Notes` column to edit inline. Press
`e` on any other column to open the full edit form. The file attachment cannot
be changed after creation.
